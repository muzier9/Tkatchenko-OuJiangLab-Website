# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research
We pursue the goals in the following areas:
- Identify genes and mutations underlying human diseases.
- Systematically predict and assess the function consequence of genetic variants across the genome.
- Investigate the changes in transcriptome and epigenome during development and under disease condition at single-cell resolution.
- Develop novel therapeutics, including gene therapy, genome editing, and neural regeneration, for treating the diseases.
