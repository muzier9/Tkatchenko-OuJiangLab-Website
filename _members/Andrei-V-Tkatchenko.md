A professor and graduate mentor, formerly serving as Director and Professor of Basic Science in Ophthalmology at the Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York. The research focuses on gene-environment interactions in refractive eye development, the characterization of visual signaling pathways that regulate eye growth, and the development of anti-myopia drugs using system genetics and pharmacogenomics methods.

Through the establishment of a pharmacogenomics-based drug development platform and its integration with large international bio and drug databases, the goal is to identify differences between normal gene networks and disease-related gene networks, fostering the development of new therapeutic drugs.

A full member of the Sigma Xi Scientific Research Honor Society and a committee member of the International Myopia Institute’s Experimental Models of Refractive and Myopia Committee. Additionally, served as a reviewer for multiple international research funding committees in Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as a reviewer for several leading international journals. Currently, serves on the editorial boards of Biomolecules (MDPI) and the European Association for Vision and Eye Research. With over 30 SCI papers published in top industry journals and participation in more than 30 international conferences, including over ten honorary lectures and three Columbia University press releases, the total research funding managed exceeds $16 million USD.
